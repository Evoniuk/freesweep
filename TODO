- On most X keymaps, both the left arrow and the down arrow don't work,
  reporting "Unknown keystroke." Unfortunately, somehow this leaves an extra
  'o' lying around, leading to a saved game getting loaded. Really fucking
  bizarre- Sun's curses doesn't have the arrows-under-X problem.

- We need to have some sort of standard header in all the files the mentions
  the copyright and GNU GPL.

- Fix up the error condition for what happens when you can't write to the best
  times file and shit. Just quitting doesn't seem to good.  Also, fix the
  creation permissions of the group file. Like either the client can make a new
  one with 666 perms, or the installer makes one with the correct permissions.

- See if purify bitches about what I wrote with the reconfig shit.

- See what purify is bitching about in the load/save game code.

- Sun's curses doesn't do standout() correctly on a Linux term.
